title: Even More Beginner (And Intermediate) Coding Resources
category: Beginner Resources
---

I decided to make a follow-up to my
[previous post](/2015/05/09/teaching-yourself-how-to-code-a-bunch-of-beginner-coding-resources)
on coding resources because I had a bunch of other resources I wanted to share,
especially some that are beyond the beginner level.

###Technology

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html) -
I just skipped through this book to learn Python syntax, and it looked like it
did a really good job of explaining the basics and covering a lot of material.
There are also other technologies covered in this family of books.

[Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com) - I never got a chance to try this out
because I started at Metis before I had the time, but I've heard it recommended
before and my friend [Eli](https://twitter.com/monkeypatchr) suggested I add this
as a resource for learning Ruby.

[Hyperpolyglot](http://hyperpolyglot.org) - This awesome site shows
primary differences between programming languages, which could be very helpful
for comparison or reference.

[OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) - OverTheWire has a series of
games that teach web and systems security. It's not just useful for learning
about security though - I've found it very helpful in gaining a deeper
understanding of how web sites and systems work.

###Life as a Developer

[Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) -
If you've finished the tutorials from my earlier post or are at a comparable
level, you're probably about at the point where coding starts to really suck.
This blog post explains how this is actually normal, and it gets better.

[CodeNewbie Podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) - CodeNewbie offers all
kinds of great resources, but I especially love the podcasts, which are
accessible, educational, and fun to listen to at any level.

[Model View Culture: Programming](https://modelviewculture.com/issues/programming) -
Model View Culture is a magazine that offers various thought-provoking social
and political perspectives on the field of tech. I think that the programming
issue in particular is a must-read for anyone entering or in tech.

[Intermediate Developers by Angelina Fabbro](https://youtu.be/v0TFmdO4ZP0) -
It doesn't get perfect after you get past the hardest stretches mentioned in
'Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard', and that's when Angelina Fabbro's talk
on being an intermediate developer is important to hear.

I've found all these resources to be incredibly helpful, especially later in my
coding journey, so I hope that others will find them useful as well!
